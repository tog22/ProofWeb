(1, '', '<p>In his argument for ''non-egalitarianism'' (the position that the equal welfare across a society is not intrinsically valuable), Michael Huemer asks us to consider three worlds. All three contain only two people, Antoinette and Bubba, and their level of welfare in the first and the second half of their lives is represented numerically as follows:</p><img src="/media/arg_text/1/huemer-inequality-worlds.png"><p>The values above are meant to take into account any unhappiness caused Antoinette in the second of half of World 2 (a.k.a. ''World 2b'') by her fall from grace. He then argues that Worlds 1 and 3 have equal value, in the way described below. He present this as a refutation of egalitarianism, on the grounds that, when compared against World 1, World 3 is a paradigmatic example of what egalitarians consider bad, so that if inequality were a bad thing in the way they suppose, World 3 would be a bad world.</p>'),
(2, '', 'This argument for scepticism draws on the possibility that we are ''brains in vats''. In this famous philosophical scenario (a variant of Descartes'' ''evil demon'' story, equivalent for all philosophical purposes), we are disembodied brains in vats, being fed experiences identical to our own, and consequently forming the same beliefs about the external world. In this story, however, the external world is not as we believe - we may have experiences as of hands, but they are illusions fed to us by a mad scientist, and our belief that we have hands is false. The philosophical problem here is that we allegedly cannot tell on the basis of our experiences that we are not <em>actually</em> in this situation, since they are exactly the experiences we would expect if we were.'),
(3, '', 'Aquinas'' ''Five Ways'' were presented as proofs of the existence of God in his <em>Summa Theologica</em> (literally: <em>The Best of Theology</em>). As you may notice, they relied heavily on Aristotelian physics, so few will nowadays accept their premises.'),
(4, '', 'Berkeley''s arguments in his books <em>Principles of Human Knowledge</em> and <em>Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous</em> aimed to show that minds were the only ''substances'', i.e. the only things capable of independent existence. This position is called ''immaterialism'', because it rejects material substance (defined by Berkeley as non-mental substance; - causal laws might count as material substances by this definition, and post-Berkeleyan science has posited substances unlike either mind or matter, ordinarily-conceived).'),
(5, '', 'Some sensible qualities are intuitively mind-dependent: pain is a good example, as unfelt pains obviously cannot exist. Berkeley thought the same held of all sensible qualities. However, he also had an argument to convince those of us who do not, leveraging our intuitions about qualities like pain, for when experiencing one quality necessarily involves experiencing another the intuitive mind-dependence of the second would show the mind-dependence of the first (since Berkeley allows no method of conceptually separating what is inseparable in sensation and imagination). <abbr class="fn" title="Introduction to the 1996 OUP edition of the Principles and Dialogues, pxix">Robinson</abbr>  calls this leveraging manoeuvre ‘the assimilation argument’, and traces it back to Aristotle. Berkeley applies assimilation arguments throughout 1D and in P10, noting for instance that experiencing extreme temperatures involves experiencing pain (plausibly adding that if extreme temperatures are thus mind-dependent so are mild temperatures, an argument independent of his contentious claim that sensing mild temperatures involves pleasure).'),
(6, '', 'This argument is often used to undermine the most common basis for the pro-life position: the thesis that embryos have the same moral status (at least when it comes to matters of life and death) as adult human beings. The following statement comes from an article by Toby Ord, which also outlines the indisputable facts behind premise 1. According to his sources, over 200 million embryos die in this way each year - as he says, if similar numbers of adult human beings died from one cause, we would regard this as a plague of epic proportions, demanding almost unlimited resources to cure. Sources on this phenomenon include:<br/>Hertig, A.T. (1967): ''The overall problem in man'', in  <em>Comparative aspects of reproductive failure</em>, edited by Benirschke (Springer-Verlag), p11–41'),

(11, 'Fitch''s Paradox', 'The obvious conclusion of this reductio ad absurdum is useful because it supports <a href="/view/ajax/view.php?id=22&type=argument>Fitch''s Paradox</a>, which can be used to show that not all truths are knowable'),
(12, 'Problem of the criterion', 'The history of the problem of the criterion goes back to the ancient sceptics. It is nowadays used to refer both to the argument presented here, and to the debate over particularism in epistemology'),
(13, 'Hume''s account of experiential reasons (for miracles)', 'Hume’s argument against believing in miracles involves a picture of how we should weigh our experiential reasons for believing different propositions that some reject. On Hume’s picture, our confidence in an empirical proposition should depend simply on the number of experiences which do and don’t fit it. The validity of the first step of this argument assumes this understanding of ‘experiential reasons’ - if we reject Hume’s picture, there may well be different reasons to accept or reject putative laws of nature of miracles.

Is it plausible that this appearance always involves self-deception?</p>\r\n<p>3) Beliefs about desires seem to provide effective motives for action - even when the desire does not actually exist. Consider a son of doctors who''s heard about medicine''s worthiness so much that he''s convinced he wants to become one himself. Imagine that this makes him choose to study medicine, only to be plagued by doubts about his career. Eventually he quits and is much happier; reflecting on his past, he decides he never <em>really</em> wanted to be a doctor, but had just convinced himself that he did. But if this is so, it seems plausible that it was his mistaken belief about this desire that motivated him to go to med school. (Source: <em>Moral Realism</em> (OUP, 2003), p125)</p>\r\n<p>Whether you find this convincing will depend on whether you think that this motivation relied on the student <em>caring</em> about pleasing his parents or doing what is worthy, and whether you think this is best understood as a desire rather than an evaluative belief. As we saw above, an acceptance of motivating evaluative beliefs is a major reason for accepting this proposition.</p>'),

It is generally agreed that, in its most naive form, this objection to interactionism rests on a ‘billiard ball’ picture of causation: if all causation is by impact, how can the material and the immaterial impact upon each other? But if causation is either by a more ethereal force or energy or only a matter of constant conjunction, there would appear to be no problem in principle with the idea of interaction of mind and body.</blockquote>\r\n<p class="comment-source">-- Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/">Dualism</a></p>\r\n<blockquote>[If] causal power was flowing in and out of the physical system, energy would not be conserved, and the conservation of energy is a fundamental scientific law. Various responses have been made to this. One suggestion is that it might be possible for mind to influence the distribution of energy, without altering its quantity. (See Averill and Keating (1981)). Another response is to challenge the relevance of the conservation principle in this context. The conservation principle states that ‘in a causally isolated system the total amount of energy will remain constant’. Whereas ‘[t]he interactionist denies…that the human body is an isolated system’, so the principle is irelevant. (Larmer (1986), 282: this article presents a good brief survey of the options.)</blockquote>\r\n<p class="comment-source">-- Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/">Dualism</a></p>'),
